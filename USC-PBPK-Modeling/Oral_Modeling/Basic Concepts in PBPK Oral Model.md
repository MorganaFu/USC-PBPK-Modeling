<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Fa%</span> (Fraction absorbed): represents the net percentage of the administered dose (accounting for absorption and exsorption) that moves from the gut lumen into the enterocytes. (PMC10535515)

Enterocytes are the major cell type in intestinal epithelium:

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">FDp%</span> (Fraction dose absorbed through the portal vein): After the drug is absorbed into enterocytes, it may be metabolized by CYP enzymes. In addition, the drug may act as a substrate for efflux transporters on the apical or basolateral membranes of the enterocytes. As a result, the amount of drug that ultimately enters the portal vein (hepatic portal system) is lower than the total amount absorbed into the enterocytes.

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">F%</span> (Bioavailability): Drug reaches the system circulation after the first-pass effect happened in the liver. After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the [digestive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_system "Digestive system") and enters the [hepatic portal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_system "Hepatic portal system"). It is carried through the [portal vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_portal_vein "Hepatic portal vein") into the [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver "Liver") before it reaches the rest of the body. The liver [metabolizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism") many drugs, sometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of [active drug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_pharmaceutical_ingredient "Active pharmaceutical ingredient") emerges from the liver to the rest of the [circulatory system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system "Circulatory system").

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Conclusions:</span> **Fa% – FDp%** represents the proportion of drug that is lost (e.g., through metabolism within enterocytes or by efflux transporters back into the gut lumen) before it can reach the portal circulation; **FDp% – F%** reflects the fraction of the dose that was lost in the liver (for example, via hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion) after reaching the portal vein but before entering the systemic circulation.

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Peff </span>(Effective Jejunal Permeability): a parameter that characterizes how readily a drug molecule can pass from the lumen of the jejunum (a segment of the small intestine) into the enterocytes and ultimately into the bloodstream. Peff is often determined in specialized in vivo or in situ studies (e.g., using intestinal perfusion techniques) or estimated using in vitro models (e.g., Caco-2 cell monolayers).

Intestinal effective permeation of drugs is one of the major biopharmaceutical processes used to determine rate and extent of gastrointestinal (GI) drug absorption. Peff was a cornerstone in the development of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), a scientific framework that has been extensively used to improve pharmaceutical development and regulatory work regarding oral dosage forms by increasing process efficiency and accuracy.(https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.24258) 

Please see the following figure, these are in-silicon simulations generated by GastroPlus:
The left panel is the test under Peff = 4.3 x 10-4 cm/s; while the right panel is the test under Peff = 2 x 10-4 cm/s (other conditions are the same); you would see a huge difference between AUC. With a lower Peff, the less amount of drug entering into small intestine.

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Stomach transit time:</span> refers to the duration a substance (such as a drug) takes to pass through the stomach after oral administration before it enters the small intestine.

Please see the following figure, these are results generated by GastroPlus:
The left panel is the test under transit time  = 0.25 h; while the right panel is the test under transit time = 1 h.
While increasing the stomach transit time from 0.25 h to 1 h indeed can delay the Tmax and reduce the Cmax, it also reduce the AUC.

This phenomenon is likely due to partial saturation of metabolism in the gut wall. When gastric emptying slows, the drug reaches the enterocytes more gradually, meaning there is less drug within the enterocytes at any given time—even if the overall Fa% remains the same. As a result, the enzymes have a longer window to metabolize the drug, reducing Fdp%, F%, and AUC.
